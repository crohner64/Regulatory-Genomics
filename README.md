# Regulatory-Genomics: An Analysis of Histone Modifications and Transcription Factors in Left Ventricular Tissues

Summary: This project focuses on the analysis of histone modifications and transcription factor activity in left ventricular tissues to better understand epigenetic regulation in the heart. The study explores how specific histone modifications and their interactions with transcription factors influence gene expression and contribute to cardiac function and disease. By employing bioinformatics tools and experimental datasets, the project identifies key regulatory mechanisms that could inform potential therapeutic targets for cardiac conditions. The analysis highlights epigenetic patterns and transcription factor binding motifs critical for understanding disease progression and tissue-specific gene regulation in the heart.

## Data Details

Samples: Left ventricular tissue samples from the publicly available ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) database. The dataset includes ATAC-Seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing) and ChIP-Seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing) data.

Features Analyzed: Histone modification patterns, transcription factor binding sites, and gene regulatory networks
